### The progress of the game:

At the beginning of the game, one player chooses a number of several digits, and the other one needs to guess the number.

The game is played in turns. the guesser has a maximum turns number, after a guessing the guesser gets clues called bulls and cows.

***Bulls*** - A situation in which one of the digits in the number is identical to a numeral in the original number and is positioned correctly.

***Cows*** - A situation in which one of the digits in the number is identical to a numeral in the original number, but is located in a different location.

Examples: Suppose that the number we are trying to guess is 1234.

The player guessed 5167 - he has one bull because the number 1 was in the original number but was not in the right place. \
The player guessed 1567 - he has one cow because the number 1 is properly positioned and exists in the original number. \
The player guessed 5678 - he did not have a single bull or cow because the number he had guessed was completely different from the original number.

#### Victory:

If the guesser ends his turns before he guessed right - he lost, technical win to the chooser. \
If the number length of the gusser is not equal to the number length it should be - he lost, technical win to the chooser. \
If the number length of the chooser is not equal to the number length it should be - he lost, technical win to the guesser.
