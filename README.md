# Bulls and Cows

This project represents a "Bulls and Cows" game.

### The progress of the game:

At the beginning of the game, one player chooses a number of several digits, and the other one needs to guess the number.

The game is played in turns with each player guessing the opponent's number, after guessing the opponent to tell the guesser what his guess is, using clues called bulls and cows.

***Bulls*** - A situation in which one of the numbers in the numeral number is the same as the number in the original number and is positioned correctly.

***Cows*** - A situation in which one of the digits in the number of the number is identical to the number in the original number, but is located in a different location.

Examples: Suppose that the number we are trying to guess is 1234.

The player guessed 5167 - he has one bull because the number 1 was in the original number but was not in the right place. \
The player guessed 1567 - he has one cow because the number 1 is properly positioned and exists in the original number. \
The player guessed 5678 - he did not have a single bull or cow because the number he had guessed was completely different from the original number.

### Victory:
Using the various guesses, the guesser is supposed to proceed through trial, error, and reasoning until he succeeds in cracking the opponent's number.
